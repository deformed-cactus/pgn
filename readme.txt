README

This is a program that allows you to input algebraic notation from 2700chess.com
and return a pgn.

You need Java to run this program.

Instructions to convert algebraic notation to pgn:
First you need to copy the moves of the game (and only the
moves) and save them as a .txt file. The file needs to be saved in the same
folder as this program.

Then, open your command line and navigate into the program's repository, which
is called "pgn".

To start the program, write java main.java in the command prompt and hit
return/enter.

The program will ask you for the name of the file where you saved the algebraic
notation. Type in the name of that file and hit return/enter.

The pgn notation is then returned. You can copy it from the command line into
lichess analysis board for example, or into a word processor and save as a pgn.

You can test the program on the "test.txt" file in the repository,
which already has some algebraic notation that requires conversion to pgn.
